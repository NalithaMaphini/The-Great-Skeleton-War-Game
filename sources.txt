* A lot of the artwork was heavily modified by me before putting it into the game.
* Some of the artwork was drawn by me, here's a list of some of things I drew for the game:
    - The arrows and other projectiles
    - The lightning effects for the mage tower
    - Most of the weapons the towers are holding
    - Most of the GUI elements
    - The skills in the skill menu
    - Some of the effects for the spells

Tower Defense Game with Ages
You start off as cavemen and you can buy rock towers and stuff however if you save up enough you can purchase the
next age which unlocks arrow towers and stuff. So it gives the player a difficult choice: spam weaker towers or risk it
and try to save up for the next age.
Age 1: Stone Age (rock towers, clubs, etc)
Age 2: Mideval Age (Arrows, Swords, Horses, etc)
Age 3: Industrial Age (Guns, Rockets, etc)
???? Age 4: Space Age (Lasers, Plasma, etc, last age)
Theme: The Great Skeleton War
Use the snake generation from my first attempted project to randomly generate levels, but it needs some modifications
1) Rather than going from left to right it will go from left corner to right
2) No matter what, the snake generation will always generate 100 blocks (or whatever number)
    i. To accomplish this have it calculate how many blocks away it is from the end and if runs out it just rushes
    the closest path to the end.
3) The snake generation cannot go through an air block

You can place towers anywhere except the air blocks (there is no grid system), however towers must at lesat a tiny
distance away from each other

Enemy Ideas:

Standard Skeleton:
Just an ordinary skeleton, weak, medium speed, nothing special, in later waves there's hundreds of these

Armored Skeleton:
Skeleton with armor, medium health, slow speed

Giant Skeleton:
Medium health, medium speed

Giant Armored Skeleton:
High health, slow speed

Behemoth Skeleton:
Super high health, super slow speed

Spooky Skeleton:
Super weak, super fast, doesn't spawn often, shiny blue color




Tower Ideas:

Traps:
Disposable, high damage, can only be placed on path, when enemy walks over them they are destroyed, cheap.
Stone Age (Boulder Trap): Rock falls down on anyone passing under
Medieval Age (Spikes): Spikes in the ground
Industrial Age (Landmine): Explodes AOE

Person Tower 1:
Good damage, medium fire rate, single target, tiny range, cheap.
Stone Age (Club Guy): Guy with a club
Medieval Age (Knight): Guy with a sword
Industrial Age (Shotgun Guy): Guy with a shotgun

Person Tower 2:
Medium damage, medium fire rate, single target, medium range, cheap.
Stone Age (Rock Thrower): Guy who throws rocks
Medieval Age (Javelin Dude): Guy with a javelin
Industrial Age (Machinegun Guy): Guy with a machinegun

Person Tower 3:
High damage, slow fire rate, single target, infinite range, moderate price.
Stone Age (Blowgun Guy): Has a blowgun
Medieval Age (Archer): Has a bow
Industrial Age (Sniper): Has a sniper

Special Tower:
High Damage, AOE, expensive.
Stone Age (Sentient Boulder): A boulder that appears randomly on the y axis of a random tile
Medieval Age (Charriot): Runs in circle hurting enemies he runs through
Industrial Age (Bomber Plane): A plane that drops bombs whenever it crosses over a path, flies in either a huge circle of figure 8 configuration.

Money Tower:
These tower do not attack enemies, rather they generate money, moderate price.
Stone Age (Rock Mine): Guy hitting a rock
Medieval Age (Farm): Grows corn and stuff
Industrial Age (Oil Rig): One of those oil digging thingies

Super Tower:
High Damage, High Fire Rate, AOE, Large Range, Super Expensive.
Stone Age (Atlatl Guy): A guy with an atlatl
Medieval Age (Mage): Casts fire spells and stuff
Industrial Age (Tank): It's a tank.

Other ideas:
    Standard Tower 1:
    High damage, very slow fire rate, AOE, medium range, expensive.
    Stone Age (Boulder Dudes): A bunch of people throwing boulders
    Medieval Age (Catapult): It's a catapult
    Industrial Age (Mortar Squad): shoot mortars

    Standard Tower 2:
    Low damage, high fire rate, single target, medum-low range, expensive.
    Stone Age (Spear Squad): A bunch of people throwing spears
    Medieval Age (Arrow Tower): A tower that fires a barrage of arrows
    Industrial Age (Foxhole): A bunch of machineguns

Snake Generation:
Rather than have a few boring maps this game has a virtually unlimited amount of maps. They are randomly generated
with an algorithm I created that I call "Snake Generation", basically it's like the snake game except the snake is
calculating where to place the path, and the entire process is like a huge "would you rather" game designated by points
and penalities. So the thinking process looks like this:
Would I rather intersect a path, go near an adjacent block, go near the edge of the map, or go into nothing?
    I would rather go through nothing since there's no penalty for doing that
Would I rather go closer to the map, intersect a path, go diagonal to a path, or go diagonal to another path?
    Go closer to map, has least amount of penalties.
etc


Wave Logic:
While on the last age, the next age button is replaced with a win game button.
The win game button will be $100,000 or some other large number
Here's how the logic works
Waves 1-20 or 1-50 or 1-something will be preset
Between each wave is a 10 second intermission
??? Make it so you can't buy during the wave and extend intermission?
Wave one has some weak skeletons that spawn slowly
Wave two has some more weak skeletons that spawn a little faster
This continues until wave 5, on wave 5 armored skeletons start spawning
Number of weak skeletons and armored skeletons increases until wave 10
On wave 10 hyperskeletons start spawning
These increase until wave 15
On wave 15 raptor skeletons start spawning
This continues until wave 20
On wave 20 skeleton liches start spawning
The rest of the game just keeps on gradually increases the spawn rates and the spawn chances of larger enemies
The game ends when either the skeletons overun the player and kill the town or the player gets enough money to win

Weak Skeletons:
Just a standard skeleton, decent speed, lowish health

Armored Skeleton:
more health, slower move speed

Hyperskeleton:
Super fast, super low hp, movement speed based on number of tiles on map, low amount tiles = slow speed, high amount
of tiles = hyperspeed. Invincible until half-way through map.

Raptor Skeleton:
High health, spawns in with slow movement speed but gradually goes faster

Skeleton Lich:
Massive health, slow speed, has a shield, moves faster when shield is depleted


The Player:
Now that you can't place towers during the round the user needs to be able to do something other than watch.
They should be able to control a weak player who can run around shooting stuff, there should be three different classes
with skill trees and stuff. To make it even cooler have it so you can only control the character during the wave, so
it sort of "Swaps" between controlling towers and the player in the wave / wave intermission

The enemies can attack the player, usually they just ignore him and run past him but sometimes they will stop and attack
him. If the player dies they respawn at the camp after 10 seconds. Each kill (tower or player) counts towards exp, the
player can spend exp on skill tree stuff.

One Does the highest DPS but risky because he has no ranged attacks, only melee, also has super high health.

One that Does meh DPS but has a ton of cool stuff like freezing or fire and stuff.

One that Does decent DPS and has ranged attack but has very low health and can't get anywhere near enemies without dying.
